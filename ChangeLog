MPC Version 2.1
MPC now provides a shared-memory module named SHM. This module has been
developed to take the advantage of intra-node communications. In the case of
inter-node communications, MPC automatically combines SHM with the selected
inter-node communication module (i.e: TCP or IPoIB).

New functionalities and bugfixes:
* new configure option : --enable-shm/--disable-shm
    Enable or disable the SHM module. SHM is enabled by default.
* new configure option : --enable-shell-colors/--disable-shell-colors
    Enable or disable colors in Shell. Shell must be vt100 capable.
* Elan module has been definitively removed from MPC.
* MPC checks the prefix given to MPC. Avoid headers (mpi.h, pthread.h, etc...)
  overwritting. This check can be disable by passing --disable-prefix-check to
  the top MPC configure.
* Lib MPC Makefile now supports the DESTDIR variable.
* When no network module is explicitly used (--net= not set), MPC uses TCP.
