C
C Thanks to zollweg@tc.cornell.edu (John A. Zollweg) for this test 
C which detected a problem in one version of the IBM product 
C implementation of MPI.  The source of the problem in that implementation
C was assuming that floating point arithmetic was associative (it isn't
C even commutative on IBM hardware).
C
C This program was designed for IEEE and may be uninteresting on other
C systems.  Note that since it is testing that the same VALUE is
C delivered at each system, it will run correctly on all systems.

C     collect the values and make sure that they are all the same BITWISE
