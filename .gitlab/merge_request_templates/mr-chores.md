## Type of change: Chores

**This MR intends to modify any part of the project not directly affecting the
runtime**, it may include (but not bound to):
* New Documentation
* New utils scripts (**not** related to the build system)
* Gitlab/Github/git related (mailmap, gitlab-ci, templates,etc.)


## Prerequisites
I ensure the proposed changes:
- [ ] are up-to-date with the default branch (currently `devel`)
- [ ] do not break basic MPC build process: `./installmpc --prefix=$PREFIX`
- [ ] can still run a simple MPI `main()`
