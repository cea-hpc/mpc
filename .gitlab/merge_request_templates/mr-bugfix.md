## Type of change: Bug fixing

**This MR does not intent to change any existing behavior nor add any new features.**

## Prerequisites
I ensure the proposed changes:
- [ ] are up-to-date with the default branch (currently `devel`)
- [ ] do not break basic MPC build process: `./installmpc --prefix=$PREFIX`
- [ ] can still run a simple MPI `main()`
- [ ] have been tested under multiple configurations, in respect of C & Fortran
  compatibilities

## Related ticket(s)

It is important to open a ticket for any bug found in MPC. This way, if the bug
arises again, it will be easier for the dev team to track down discussions
around how to resolve it.
