## TL;DR

A good habit is to provided here a short summary of your issue here. It
intends to give a global picture of your comments and let people decide if they
want go in-depth on this subject.

## Description

Content in this section does not have any guidelines. Note some Gitlab-specific
Markdown stylish guides:
* Reference issues by prefixing its number with `#`: #30
* Reference MR by prefixing its number with `!`: !11
* Reference a commit by putting the SHA1 (shorten or not)
* Reference a file from repo (even add a line number ref): `[link
  name](path/file#LXX)`: [README](README#L8) (not working from Wiki pages)
* Reference a commit range `commitA...commitB`: 554f8fc9...51753d51 (with
  **THREE** dots !)
* Not allowed to reference a branch name (with a link) as a branch is a "moving"
  ref and it would not have a sense to link it at a given momentum

Finally, add any flair you consider useful to classify your issue (feature, C,
MPI, etc.).
