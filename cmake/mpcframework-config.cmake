FindMPCFRAMEWORK
-------

Finds the MPCFRAMEWORK library.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides the following imported targets, if found:

``MPCFRAMEWORK::MPCFRAMEWORK``
  The MPCFRAMEWORK library

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables:

``MPCFRAMEWORK_FOUND``
  True if the system has the MPCFRAMEWORK library.
``MPCFRAMEWORK_VERSION``
  The version of the MPCFRAMEWORK library which was found.
``MPCFRAMEWORK_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include directories needed to use MPCFRAMEWORK.
``MPCFRAMEWORK_LIBRARIES``
  Libraries needed to link to MPCFRAMEWORK.

FindMPI Like
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that for now we do not support fortran in variables below yet.
<lang> is in (C, CXX)

``MPI_FOUND``
  Variable indicating that MPI settings for C/CXX was found

``MPI_VERSION``
  Minimal version of MPI detected among the requested languages, or all enabled languages if no components were specified.

This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where <lang> is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``MPI_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating the MPI settings for <lang> were found and that simple MPI test programs compile with the provided settings.

``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER``
  MPI compiler for <lang> if such a program exists.

``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include path(s) for MPI header.

``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
   All libraries to link MPI programs against.


Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``MPCFRAMEWORK_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory containing ``mpc.h`` and ``mpi.h``.
``MPCFRAMEWORK_LIBRARY``
  The path to the MPCFRAMEWORK library.
