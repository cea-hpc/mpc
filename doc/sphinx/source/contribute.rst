How to contribute to MPC
========================

How to use Gitlab (MPC-related)?
The first thing to do is sign up (https://gitlab.paratools.com). Please note
the following about creating a new account:

An filter restricts allowed domains when creating an account. Domains
cea.fr, atos.net or exascale-computing.eu are allowed (among others).
If you are not able to create an account because of the forbidden email domain space,
please contact the team under Contact section).
Please use the email from well-known institutions (no Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail
domains are permitted)
An automatic ban is applied by the frontend hosting Gitlab after three failed
authentications within an hour. Please note that people using a shared IP (for
instance because using the same outgoing VPN relay), these people will
share this restriction rule. Once banned, feel free to contact any of the
Gitlab Administrators (see below) and provide your current IP address to
unban.

For more information about Gitlab semantics and their role under MPC QA
management, the documentation is segmented into multiple pages, the table of
contents is reachable on your right-hand side. Here is a list of useful
shortcuts, more to be appended over time :
