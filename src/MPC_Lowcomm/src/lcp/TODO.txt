* Add support for InfiniBand
* Handle truncated messages
* Add "const" whenever possible
* Verify how request data is written back to user
* Clean me management in portals
* Handle pending requests when endpoint still connecting 
* [BUG] handle rail limits in context config. In portals right now, 
  max msg size is 64MB so fragments should not exceeds that value.
* [PERF] with small fragment size, bad performances because of the limit
  1024 MD. Now, we queue the request when we hit the limit but only one 
  ptl event at a time is red when calling eq_poll so the only a few 
  fragments can be completed. It is possible to read multiple event at
  a time when polling the event queue. We could improve performance by
  doing so.
